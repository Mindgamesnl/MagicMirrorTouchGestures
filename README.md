# MagicMirror Touch Gestures
A module that adds touch gestures to the MagicMirror project

# The project
Recently, one of my teachers told me about his Smart Mirror project, he wanted to control his local devices (NEST, but maybe something more in the future) via touch gestures.

Goals:
 - Finish it in less then 2 weeks, because thats when i stop going to this school 5 days a week.
 - Make it responsive on every panel.
 - Implement the NEST api.
 - Translate electron touch events to a usable API.
